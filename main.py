# what is for loop
# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects
# Iterating over a sequence is called traversal
# break and continue can be used inside for loop


for element in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(element)

print("....................")

for element in "Hello World!":
    print(element)

print("....................")

for element in range(6): # range(1, 6)
    print(element)
print("....................")


for element in range(1, 20, 3):
    print(element)
print("....................")

# range can also go in the reverse direction
